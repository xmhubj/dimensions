### Branches in a Nutshell

> Some people refer to Git's branching model as its "killer feature".

- A branch represents an independent line of development. 
- A way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history.
- New commits are recorded in the history for the current branch, which results in a fork in the history of the project.
